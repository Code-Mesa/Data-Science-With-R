# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

## 🚀 Description
Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. This well-known dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their survival status, demographics, and ticket details. It is commonly used for practicing data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, incorrect data entries, and outliers in the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Explore relationships between passenger features and survival rates.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of features and factors affecting survival.
- **Report Generation**: Summarize your analysis with a detailed report including visualizations and key insights.

## 🛠️ Skills Covered
- **🧹 Data Cleaning**: Techniques for dealing with missing data, errors, and inconsistencies.
- **📈 Statistical Analysis**: Explore correlations and statistical significance of different features on survival.
- **🎨 Data Visualization**: Generate plots like histograms, bar charts, and survival plots to illustrate key findings.
- **📑 Report Generation**: Present your findings in a structured and informative report.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **R Programming**: Utilize R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **R Libraries**: Use libraries such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyverse` for data wrangling and visualization.

## 📚 Dataset Details
- **Dataset Name**: Titanic Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Description**: Contains information about 891 passengers including features like age, sex, class, fare, and whether they survived the Titanic disaster.

## 🔄 Steps to Complete the Project
1. **Load the Dataset**: Import the Titanic dataset into R.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Clean the data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
3. **Perform EDA**: Analyze the data using statistical methods and create visualizations to explore relationships and trends.
4. **Generate Insights**: Identify key factors influencing survival and summarize your findings.
5. **Prepare a Report**: Document your analysis, visualizations, and insights in a comprehensive report.

By working on this project, you'll develop essential skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using a real-world dataset.
